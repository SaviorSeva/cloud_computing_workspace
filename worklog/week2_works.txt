Things done :
	- _interrupt_service_routine function in irqs.s
	- rx tx and rt handlers in uart.c
	- enable UART fifo in uart.c
	- jump to irq handler in vector.s
	- individual irq stacks in linker script


Questions not solved :
- Can't figure out to send interrupt signal to vic, even if it's enabled. The handlers are listening to
  port 12, which is the UART interrupt entry.

- UART does not change its interrupt status. 

- Terminal stops working (due to receive & send does not working).
