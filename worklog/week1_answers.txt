Week1.step1
- VAP and VPB compilation ? 
    -- Yes

- Same processor ?
    -- No. The VAP board is arm926 CPU, and the VPB board has a cortex-a8 cpu.

- Same amount of memory ?
    -- No. The VAP board has 1M byte memory and the VPB has 32M byte.

- What is that bss section and why it needs to be reset to 0 ?
    -- A section contains un-initialized variables.

- Relationship between these global variables and the different data sections?
    -- Uninitialized global variables (or initialized as 0) are stored in bss sectors,
    -- Initialized global variables are stored in data sectors,
    -- Local variables are stored in stacks.

- Experiment with "arm-none-eabi-objdump" 
    -- By using command "arm-none-eabi-objdump -d" on kernel.elf, we can see all
       the instructions in memory.
    -- By using command "arm-none-eabi-objdump -d" on main.o, we can see the ins-
       tructions of function _start.

- Why is the bss section aligned on a 16-byte boundary?
    -- Because in reset.s, it resets 16 bits at the same time. When we assign space to 
       data sectors (by .data : { *(.data) } ), alignment is not considered. So before 
       assigning the bss section we need to align the data.

Week1.step2
- Understand boot sequence with gdb ?
    -- Yes. Start the program by "make debug", then launch gdb-multiarch on kernel.elf.
       Let gdb connect to localhost:1234 (as defined in Makefile), then we're good to go.
    -- Upon startup, the pc register is 0x0, therefore it will fetch the instruction loc-
       ated at 0x0, which is _vector in linker script file. Then it jumps to the _reset 
       function, which is located at 0x1000. After _reset is done it will jump to start by
       instruction "bl _start", then it will execute the start() function in main.c.

- Remove the periodic "Zzzz..." output. Why was it there? What does that tell you about the 
  execution?
    -- It indicates that the loop has been looping 10 millions times. Which tells us that 
       the program is not halting, it's executing forever and consuming countless energies!
    -- If we remove it all we can see is a blank terminal as nothing is displayed.

- Why is the symbol _stack_top defined and why is it at the end of everything?
    -- _stack_top is defined to indicate the top of the stack (which is 0x22a0 in this case).
       Because stack is growing downwards, so it needs to be in the end of the section.

- How can you verify in C that the stack is working properly?
    -- Stack stores temporarily local variables. Which means that in the main.c program, var-
       iable i and count are stored in stacks. Set a breakpoint at main.c:18, then use the c-
       ommand "p/x &i" and "p/x &count" in gdb, it shows that i is located at 0x2290 and count
       is located at 0x2294, which is above the _stack_top (0x22a0) and they're inside stack
       section.

- What would happen if we were to call to many functions in C?
- How could you verify that your C program executes safely?
    -- TODO

- Had support for kprintf, see the file "kprintf.c".
    -- By calling uart_send(UART0, c) in void kputchar(int c), I managed to make kprintf() wor-
       king. I'm not sure whether it's the right approach or not ...

Week1.step3
- Make sure you understand the UART BAR, register offsets, and bit fields.

- Ask QEMU to emulate a second serial line, via a telnet connection.
    1- Changing "QEMU_SERIAL=-serial mon:stdio -serial telnet:localhost:4321,server,nowait" in 
       Makefile.
    2- UART0 is used for stdio, and UART1 is used for the telnet.

- Direct kprintf to output via that second serial line ?
    -- Done by changing "uart_send(UART1, c);" in void kputchar().

- Use that to print the byte values representing the encoding of the typed characters on the ke-
  yboard.
    -- Done. Check send_binary() in main.c.

- Watch what happens when hitting regular letters, like 'a' 'b' 'A' and 'B'.
    -- The letter itself and its binary form are well shown in the telnet terminal.

- Watch what happens when hitting special keys:
- left, right, up, and down arrows:
    -- The cursor in the main terminal (not the telnet one) moves with the inputs. It won't go 
       outside the terminal though. In the telnet terminal it shows that it prints 3 different 
       characters, perhaps the arrow keys input are not in ascii format. Or plainly there's so-
       me problem in the code for converting them into binary.
- backspace 
    -- Nothing happens. The letters are not deleted. In telnet console it detects the input as
       01111111. 
-- delete
    -- Nothing happens. The letters are not deleted. In telnet console it detects the input as
       3 different characters, '[', '3' and '~'. Again this could be an ascii issue or problem 
       inside the code.
